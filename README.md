## **About Me**  
I am a research scholar at **IIT Ropar** under **Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar**, specializing in **Student engagement, Collective Intelligence, and Gaze Analysis**. With **14 years of teaching experience**, I am passionate about **AI-driven education** and designing **interactive learning environments**.  

Currently, I serve as the **Curriculum Scientist** for the **Minor in AI programme** at IIT Ropar, where I contribute to **course design, assessment strategies, and curriculum innovation**.  

## **Research Interests**  
ðŸ”¹ **Social Computing** â€“ Exploring digital interactions and collective problem-solving.  
ðŸ”¹ **Gaze Analysis** â€“ Studying attention and engagement in learning environments.  
ðŸ”¹ **AI in Education** â€“ Developing **Continuous Active Learning (CAL)** frameworks for improved student engagement.  
ðŸ”¹ **Learning Analytics** â€“ Using data to optimize learning experiences.  

## **Dhananjaya Lab for Education Design (DLED)**  
I am part of the **Dhananjaya Lab for Education Design (DLED)**, where we work at the intersection of **AI, data analytics, and educational technology**. Our team is dedicated to **designing adaptive, engaging, and impactful learning experiences** that cater to diverse learners. We believe in **collaborative problem-solving**, leveraging **AI-driven insights** to enhance teaching methodologies and learning environments.  

## **Projects & Initiatives**  
### **ViBe: The Future of Learning â€“ Engage. Enjoy. Enlighten.**  
At **DLED, we** are developing **ViBe (Vision-Based Engagement)**â€”an **AI-driven educational platform** designed to enhance learning engagement through **real-time analytics and adaptive strategies**. This software is the result of **team collaboration and interdisciplinary research**, and it is still **a work in progress** as we continuously refine and improve its capabilities.  

### **Key Features of ViBe (CAL) [Work in Progress]:**  
âœ” **AI-Powered Tracking** â€“ We analyze student engagement in real-time using advanced gaze and attention models.  
âœ” **Interactive Assessments** â€“ Our system embeds quizzes and real-time feedback to enhance learning retention.  
âœ” **Micro-Learning & Gamification** â€“ We design **short, engaging modules** that improve comprehension and motivation.  
âœ” **Adaptive Learning Paths** â€“ Our AI-driven algorithms personalize learning based on individual performance and engagement patterns.  

We believe that **education is an evolving space**, and **ViBe** is an ongoing effort to create **smarter, more interactive, and adaptive learning environments**. As we continue to iterate and develop, we welcome insights and collaborations to refine our approach.
